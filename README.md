## Learning Torch
###### Learning to program in Lua using "Torch" and other useful libraries

[`Torch`](http://torch.ch/) is a scientific computing framework for LuaJIT.

Why learn Torch?
- comes with a large ecosystem of community-driven packages in ML, CV, etc
- is easy to use and efficient
- can build arbitrary graphs of neural networks, and parallelize them over CPUs and GPUs in an efficient manner

TODO
- check and use
  [Moses](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md)
- go through [nn](https://github.com/torch/nn) module documentation and check
  how some to the functionality is implemented
- Read [`LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey`](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04069v1.pdf)
  and implement LSTM.
- Read [`Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder
  for Statistical Machine Translation`](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078.pdf) and
  implement a GRU.

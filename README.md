## Learning Torch
###### Learning to program in Lua using "Torch" and other useful libraries

[`Torch`](http://torch.ch/) is a scientific computing framework for LuaJIT.

##### Why learn Torch?
- comes with a large ecosystem of community-driven packages in ML, CV, etc
- is easy to use and efficient
- can build arbitrary graphs of neural networks, and parallelize them over CPUs and GPUs in an efficient manner

##### TODO
- [x] Go through Torch documentation and try using useful functions.
- [x] Go through other useful modules and try to use them.
- [ ] Check and use
  [`Moses`](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md)
- [ ] Go through [`nn`](https://github.com/torch/nn) module documentation and check
  how some to the functionality is implemented
- [x] Start implementing something real
  - [x] Read and process process data as needed by the network.
  - [ ] Read [`LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey`](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04069v1.pdf)
  and implement LSTM.
  - [ ] Read [`Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder
  for Statistical Machine Translation`](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078.pdf) and
  implement a GRU.

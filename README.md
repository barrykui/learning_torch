## Learning Torch
###### Learning to program in Lua using "Torch" and other useful libraries

[`Torch`](http://torch.ch/) is a scientific computing framework for LuaJIT.

Why learn Torch?
- comes with a large ecosystem of community-driven packages in ML, CV, etc
- is easy to use and efficient
- can build arbitrary graphs of neural networks, and parallelize them over CPUs and GPUs in an efficient manner
